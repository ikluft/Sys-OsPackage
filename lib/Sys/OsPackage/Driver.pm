=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $ospkg = Sys::OsPackage->instance();

  # check if packaging commands exist for this system
  if (not $ospkg->call_pkg_driver(op => "implemented")) {
    return 0;
  }

  # find OS package name for Perl module
  my $pkgname = $ospkg->call_pkg_driver(op => "find", module => $module);

  # install a Perl module as an OS package
  my $result1 = $ospkg->call_pkg_driver(op => "modpkg", module => $module);

  # install an OS package
  my $result2 = $ospkg->call_pkg_driver(op => "install", pkg => $pkgname);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

⛔ This is for Sys::OsPackage internal use only.

The Sys::OsPackage method call_pkg_driver() will call the correct driver for the running platform.

All the platforms' packaging drivers must use this class as their parent class.
